## Features

- **Two HTML Pages**:

  - **Home Page**: The landing page that loads by default or can be accessed by clicking the logo in the navbar.
  - **Profile Page**: Accessible via the dropdown menu by clicking the user icon in the navbar.

- **Dynamic Elements**: Includes a dropdown menu for user settings and notifications, enhancing interactivity.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges I faced during this project was implementing responsive design properties to ensure compatibility across various devices. This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of CSS and improve my skills in creating adaptable layouts.

Additionally, I learned more about DOM manipulation while implementing the dropdown menu and other interactive elements.

## Technologies Used
